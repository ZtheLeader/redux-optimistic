# Redux Optimistic Updates

### Motivation
While working with TanStack Query React, it was the first time I came to know about what an [optimistic update](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/framework/react/guides/optimistic-updates) is and how could it increase the overall UX. In terms of performance, every CRUD operation became so fast and the overall state management became so organized.

But not every application is big-enough that it needs a separate library just to achieve optimistic updates (I know TQR also provides many other useful benefits, and you should check them out).
